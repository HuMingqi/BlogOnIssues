Welcome to my _Blog on Issues_!
======
Each issue of the repository just a article by me.
------
Do you think what is the Blog? The key points I believe are as follows:  
* __Record__
* __Broadcast__
* __Interaction__

The Issues feature of Github repository supports all above! And  
it also supports Markdown syntax, it's concise and convenient!  

So I select it as my Blog platform.  
You can reply me by comments but **please don't create issues here!**
